          <article>
            <p>This is me drumming in a studio. When I took a year off from work, one of the things I did was start a band and release an EP. We wanted to be a punk band, but none of us could play that fast, especially the drummer. So the music is more like indie rock you might have heard on college radio in the 90s.</p>
            <p>Here is a link to the EP that you can hear for free: <a class="page-link" href="https://threellllama.bandcamp.com/album/catch-this" target="_blank">Bandcamp</a></p>

            <p>This is me next to Michelle Obamaâ€™s portrait in DC. If I could meet anyone famous, I would want to meet her. She seems so smart and also kind and thoughtful and authentic. This is a combination of traits I admire.</p>
