        <p>Voters are craving communication that feels authentic from their elected officials, and with some notable presidential exceptions, they are not getting it.</p>

        <p>I can help with that.</p>
        <p>I have over 15 years of experience running customer support teams, writing emails turning pissed off customers into happy customers.</p>
        <p>I can help elected officials or their staffers write engaging newsletters, emails, or posts, filled with personality and detail.</p>
